Just a simple object oriented way to multiply matrices for an n-number rows and collumns of a matrix. Error checking included. 

To use create an object Matrix and use operators *= += -= or = to set, multiply, subtract, and add matrices

Adibes by simple linear algebra rules, matrix dimentions must agree
  - Only case for that is different is for scalars, can multiply any matrix by a 1x1 matrix
